title=Throw exception when cast system classloader to URLClassLoader
description=In JDK 8 , system classloader is a subclass of URLClassLoader, but this is not true in JDK 11. \
  Casting system classloader to URLClassLoader will cause class cast exception.
solution=Do not depend on the system classloader's type, it's JDK internal implementation.
